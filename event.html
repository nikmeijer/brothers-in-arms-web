            <p class="m-col-span-full">Diwali or Deepavali, which means a row of lights, is the biggest and most popular ancient festival of our Dharmic traditions. Celebrated by Hindus, Sikhs, and Jains, the festival marks the return of joy to our minds, going from darkness to light & new beginnings symbolized by the return of Sri Rama to Ayodhya, Bandi Chorr Divas and Nirvana of Mahavira. Like the row of lights lit from a single source, all of us and everything is one with the Universe and powered by the same source.
                Since 2012, Srishti Foundation has brought our communities together in a joyous celebration of Diwali in London, ON. Our celebrations have been sold-out events every year with up to 1200 in attendance, in 2023. Our focus remains on delivering the best possible Diwali experience, keeping it true to its traditional roots, along with masti, with something in it for everyone. Our celebrations and attendees epitomize the vast diversity from all regions of Bharat, Nepal, the Caribbean, Sri Lanka, Fiji, and North America, truly a global Diwali.</p>
